This code appears to be a configuration file written in the format of a properties file, rather than Java code. Therefore, it does not have a specific Java version associated with it.

To make it compatible with Java 17, you can keep the code as is since it doesn't contain any Java code. However, you can modify the content to match the properties and configuration changes according to Java 17 and Spring Boot 2.5, as shown below:

```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ms?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=pass@word1
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
server.port=8081
eureka.client.fetch-registry=true
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true
spring.application.name=Department
eureka.client.service-url.default-zone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

Note that the changes include updating the MySQL driver class name, adding additional database properties, and adjusting the URL configuration.

If you have any actual Java code that needs to be upgraded to Java 17, please provide it, and I would be happy to help you further.
